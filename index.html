<p> Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English engineer and 
	computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the <b>world wide web</b>. He made a proposal for an 
	information management system in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful 
	communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in 
	mid-November the same year.</p>

    <p>In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. 
		Named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century, Berners-Lee 
		has received a number of other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the "Inventor of the 
		<b>world wide web</b>" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in 
		person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium. He tweeted "This is 
		for everyone", which instantly was spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 
		people in the audience. Berners-Lee received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide 
		Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to 
		scale".</p>

	<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>

	<p>The <b>world wide web</b> (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents 
		and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by 
		hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the 
		<b>world wide web</b> in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while 
		employed at <a href="https://home.cern/about" target="_blank">CERN</a> in Switzerland. The Web browser was released outside of <a href="https://home.cern/about" target="_blank">CERN</a> in 1991, first to 
		other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in 
		August 1991.</p>
